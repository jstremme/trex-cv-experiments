Contains code and instructions for analyzing experiments with the [trex](https://github.com/mooch443/trex) computer vision tool

### About

### Build the Trex Environment

The instructions and code in this repository have been tested on MacOS Big Sur Version 11.5.1 with an Intel Core i7 processor and 32 GB memory.  To build the environment on this or a similar machine, follow the steps below.  For more information about using [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) (which powers Trex) in a MacOS [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment), see [this post](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/153).

### Analyze experiments

### Contributing

To contribute features, bug fixes, tests, examples, or documentation to this codebase, please submit a pull request with a description of your proposed changes or additions.

Please include a brief description of your pull request when submitting code and ensure that your code follows the [Pep 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.  To do this run `pip install black` and `black spacy-for-family-history` to reformat files within your copy of the project using the [black code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black).  The black code formatter is a PEP 8 compliant, opinionated formatter that reformats entire files in place.  You can also use the [autopep8 code formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AutoPEP8) within your IDE to ensure Pep 8 compliance.
